### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nina and I'm a postdoctoral research scientist in cloud physics at the Columbia University's Center for Climate Systems Research and the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on constraining cloud feedbacks in climate models using satellite observations.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and its capabilities for geoscience.
- ðŸ“« My contact info can be found at https://ccsr.columbia.edu/people/nina-crnivec.

I received my PhD from the LMU Munich where I investigated the three-dimensional interaction between inhomogeneous cloud structures and atmospheric radiation. I'm a co-developer of the radiative transfer package libRadtran, which is freely available at http://www.libradtran.org. For the purpose of my PhD research I extended the classic Î´-Eddington two-stream radiation scheme to incorporate partial cloudiness following the maximum-random overlap assumption. Inspired by the Tripleclouds concept of Shonk and Hogan (2008) I further designed the _Tripleclouds radiation solver based on the core-shell model for convective clouds_. Both algorithms were implemented into libRadtran and are easy to use! :smirk:
